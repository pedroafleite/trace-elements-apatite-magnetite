# trace-elements-apatite-magnetite
Code for statistical analysis in Master's dissertation, named: 

*Trace element geochemistry of apatite and magnetite in gold systems of the Alta Floresta mineral province, NW Brazil: Petrogenetic and metallogenic implications*.


This R code contains some interesting machine learning algorithms for statistical analysis:
- Multiple linear regression
- Ridge regression
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Log ratio transformations for compositional data analysis (CoDA)

It also contains some interesting data visualisation techniques:
- Multiple boxplot visualisation
- Biplots (for PCA)
- Design of petrological diagrams

Most of the code is interchangeable between apatite and magnetite trace element data.
The code is still a bit of a mess. I wasn't planning to publish it. But I will polish it up occasionally, where needed.
