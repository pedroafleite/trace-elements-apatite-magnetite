# trace-elements-apatite-magnetite
Code for statistical analysis in Master's dissertation, named: *Trace element geochemistry of apatite and magnetite in gold systems of the Alta Floresta mineral province, NW Brazil: Petrogenetic and metallogenic implications*.

Most of the code is interchangeable between apatite and magnetite trace element data.
The code is still a bit of a mess, because I wasn't planning to publish it. But I will polish it up occasionally, where needed.
