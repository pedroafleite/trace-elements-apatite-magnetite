# Statistical analysis of trace elements in apatite and magnetite
Code for statistical analysis in Master's dissertation, named: 

*Trace element geochemistry of apatite and magnetite in gold systems of the Alta Floresta mineral province, NW Brazil: Petrogenetic and metallogenic implications*.

The work is displayed in the following R markdowns:
[Part 1: Data Exploration of Trace Elements in Apatite](https://github.com/pedroafleite/trace-elements-apatite-magnetite/blob/main/part1_apatite.md#part-1-data-exploration-of-trace-elements-in-apatite)
[Part 2: Multivariate Discriminat Analysis in Apatite](https://github.com/pedroafleite/trace-elements-apatite-magnetite/blob/main/part2_apatite_discriminant.md)


This R code contains machine learning algorithms for statistical analysis of geochemical data:
- Multiple linear regression
- Ridge regression
- Lasso
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Log ratio transformations for compositional data analysis (CoDA)

It also contains interesting data visualisation techniques:
- Multiple boxplot visualisation
- Biplots (for PCA)
- Design of petrological diagrams

Most of the code is interchangeable between apatite and magnetite trace element data.
The code is still a bit of a mess. I wasn't planning to publish it. But I will polish it up occasionally, where needed.
